Cat Clicker is a simple memory game built with [React](https://reactjs.org/). When the user clicks on a cat that hasn't already been clicked, the score increases by one, and the images are shuffled. Should the user click the same cat twice, the game is reset.

## Challenges
Although this was a simple web application, it was also my first React project. It forced me to rethink how I write front end code by breaking up the UI into distinct components and managing their states. The syntax also took some getting used to. 

## Potential Changes
* As I get more comfortable with React, I plan on refactoring this to better follow the best practices when using this library.
